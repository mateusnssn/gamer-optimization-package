Just a set of scripts to prepare the system to perform functions more fluidly

Use my code and be happy; If you need, use [`./recovery`](./recovery/) directory scripts as a restore point method.


### Services

Use the powershell file with administrator authorization to disable some services that can be, in most cases, useless.

### Optimization for HDD if your hardware case

Replace the `system.ini` file in `C:\Windows` directory, for this you will need full access, I will leave a tutorial in the future if you have many requests for this. But I also recommend [NSudo](https://github.com/M2TeamArchived/NSudo) for that.
